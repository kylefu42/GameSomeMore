                        <p>KickBeat: Steam Edition is a rhythm game released in 2013 by Zen Studios. It is unique in the
                            fact that it blends music and "fighting" together into a surprisingly fun game. Your goal in
                            KickBeat is to defend
                            the Orb of Music from attackers who want its power. You stand in the center of a circle, and
                            the enemies walk slowly around you. When the reach a side of the circle (left, right, top,
                            or bottom) they will attempt to attack you. When this happens, you have to push the button
                            corresponding to the side they are coming from. (WASD by default.) </p>

                        <p>KickBeat is simple but addictive game. Nothing feels better that whooping random enemies to
                            the beat of your favorite songs, and KickBeat lets you do so near-flawlessly. Its campaign
                            mode has just enough twists to keep it interesting, whether it be a "boss battle" or moving
                            to a new location, with character and enemy outfits to match. While the game can be
                            confusing and even overwhelming (try Master difficulty and you'll understand) it is never
                            frustrating to the point of not being fun anymore. A definite buy for music lovers! </p>

                        <p>Teleglitch: Die More Edition is an indie top-down shooter released in 2013 by
                            Paradox Interactive. It is very similar to other dungeon-crawler games like Nethack in
                            nature, and does a good job
                            of living up to it. The game features randomly generated levels, healthy amounts of loot,
                            unhealthy amounts of enemies, and plenty of secrets. </p>

                        <p>Teleglitch is an immersive game, to say the least. The atmosphere that is created through the
                            sparse lighting, strange background noises and strange visual quirks is rare. If I had to
                            compare it, the closest game I've played to this would be the flash game K.O.L.M. Teleglitch
                            has very fun gameplay, involving plenty of exploration, murder, and looting. Overall, I
                            definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an action-horror dungeon-crawling
                            shooter.</p>

                        <p>Battlefield 4 is a FPS released by EA and developed by DICE in 2013. It is the sequel to
                            Battlefield 3, and improves on it in many ways. Battlefield 4 focuses on team play
                            unlike some other shooters, and this can make the game more or less fun depending on
                            circumstance. There are tons of maps, many of them being DLC. Vehicles are a good aspect of
                            the game, but can be annoying due to respawn times. Levolution is a mind-blowing aspect of
                            the game, and certainly can make for some interesting battles.</p>

                        <p>I love Battlefield 4, but it has its flaws, like every game. First, the game took too long to
                            perfect. Major issues took forever to fix, and even now DICE is still working on perfecting
                            the game. This can make your first impression a negative one, and leave you frustrated while
                            DICE lags behind on bug fixes. Secondly, Battlepacks are one of the dumbest mechanics I've
                            seen is a while. Each battlepack contains random weapons attachments, XP boosts,
                            customization options, or other things. This sounds fine, but there are some attachments
                            that can ONLY be acquired through these, and each attachment is gun-specific. So, you may
                            end up frustrated as you cannot get the attachment you want for the gun you want. And with
                            more than 50 guns in the game, you might be waiting a while. This wouldn't be so bad if they
                            came easily, but you either have to level up for them or BUY them. On the bright side,
                            Battlefield 4 is
                            unique and massively fun, whether you're in a tank, boat, helicopter, or foot soldier. A
                            definite recommendation, especially now that many of the major bugs have been fixed.</p>

                        <p>Need for Speed Rivals is a racing game released in 2013 by EA. The game was developed by
                            Ghost
                            Games
                            and Criterion, leaving DICE open to work on Battlefield 4. It is similar to NFS Hot Pursuit
                            in
                            style, but has several differences. The world is more rural than Most Wanted's, focusing on
                            straighter roads to complement the top speeds of some of the hypercars. Also, there is more
                            customization than there was in Most Wanted, with car color and performance upgrades being
                            available. </p>

                        <p>I honestly liked this game, but several things hurt it a LOT. Firstly, the world, while
                            beautifully rendered, is lacking, with few side streets and more dirt paths that you just
                            don't
                            want to drive your Ferrari on. Most roads are fairly straight, and this can cause some
                            boring
                            sections during races. Secondly, the story is TERRIBLE. Most, of the time, you're ignoring
                            it as
                            some
                            guy goes on a monologue over some strange techno visuals. The cars don't feel special, since
                            they
                            are
                            overshadowed by newer, faster ones that you unlock every time you finish a chapter of the
                            game's "story." The
                            DLCs
                            only
                            unlock a couple of cars and are WAY overpriced, at 5 buck for two or three decent cars. On
                            the bright side, the physics are GREAT. Drifting is amazing, and it is pretty easy to pull
                            off some sick moves.
                            Overall, I
                            would recommend to skip Rivals unless it's really your thing, and instead either go for the
                            cheaper Most Wanted, which is
                            better
                            in
                            most ways, or wait for NFS 2015.</p>

                        <p>Need For Speed Most Wanted (2012) is a racing game released by EA studios and developed
                            by
                            DICE
                            and
                            Criterion
                            Games. It is the spiritual successor to the 2005 Need for Speed Most wanted, but shares
                            many
                            differences.
                            Firstly, do NOT think of this game as the sequel to the original, or you will be
                            disappointed.
                            For
                            sharing
                            the same name, there are very few similarities between the two. This installment focuses
                            more on
                            the
                            sleek and shiny cars than the "gangsta" atmosphere of the first, and the game's interface
                            looks
                            extremely clean to reflect
                            that, as well as the memorable rap music of the first being replaced by below-average pop.

                        <p>The game is excellent, but does not live up to its predecessor. Some of its features are
                            great,
                            such
                            as
                            the frantic multiplayer, but it's missing a lot. The "bosses" are way too easy (specially
                            with the DLC that gives you a Bugatti right off the bat), there
                            are
                            only 8
                            or
                            so events per car, and eventually travelling the beautiful open world becomes pointless
                            thanks
                            to a
                            fast-travel like system. It is an extremely fun game, with high-octane action and crazy
                            stunts,
                            but
                            it can be stress-inducing, especially when driving hypercars that will crash on a pebble.
                            Overall, I recommend this
                            for
                            the
                            fun
                            I've had playing it, but buy at you own risk. If you want to see some gameplay, check out
