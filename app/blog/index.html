        <p>A quick update: I'm still doing well, and of course I'm working on the site slowly. However, I'm not sure
            when my next video will be, but I definitely have big plans for summer. Stay tuned for the future...

        <p>Merry Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa/other religious holiday! I am taking a break to play a bunch COD WaW Custom
            Zombies maps(thanks Steam sales),
            and I might upload some of it soon. I am also definitely getting GTA V for PC, and will try to upload that.
            Other games that I have acquired recently are Torchlight II, Fallout: New Vegas (+ DLC), and KickBeat.
